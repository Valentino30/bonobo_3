# Authentication State Inconsistency Fix

## Problem Description

Users could end up in an impossible state where:
- ✅ They have **paid** and can access AI insights
- ✅ They have **entitlements** in the database
- ❌ But **profile screen shows login** instead of logged-in state

This created a confusing UX where users had paid but appeared not to be logged in.

## Root Cause

The issue occurs when **email confirmation is enabled** in Supabase:

1. User completes payment → Shown payment auth screen
2. User creates account → `signUp()` succeeds, account created
3. **No session created** because email confirmation is required
4. Payment service checks entitlements by `device_id` → Has access ✅
5. Profile screen checks for active session → No session → Shows login ❌

### Authentication Flow Analysis

**Payment Service** (`utils/payment-service.ts:45-134`):
```typescript
// Checks entitlements by device_id OR user_id
static async hasAccess(chatId?: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const deviceId = await getDeviceId()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  // Works with EITHER device_id OR user_id
  if (user) {
    query = query.or(`user_id.eq.${user.id},device_id.eq.${deviceId}`)
  } else {
    query = query.eq('device_id', deviceId)
  }
}
```

**Profile Screen** (`app/profile.tsx:49-63`):
```typescript
// Only checks for active session with email
const loadProfile = async () => {
  const user = await AuthService.getCurrentUser()

  if (!user || !user.email) {
    // Not authenticated - show login screen
    setIsAuthenticated(false)
    return
  }
}
```

**Auth Service** (`utils/auth-service.ts:230-247`):
```typescript
static async getCurrentUser(): Promise<UserProfile | null> {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  if (!user) return null

  return {
    email: user.email || '',
    userId: user.id,
    isAnonymous: !user.email, // If no email, consider it anonymous
  }
}
```

### The Disconnect

- **Payment system**: Works with `device_id` → User has access
- **Auth system**: Requires active session with email → User not logged in
- **Result**: Inconsistent state ❌

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Recommended)

**Why**: Mobile apps with payments need immediate access after account creation.

**How**: In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Email Auth**
2. Turn **OFF** "Enable email confirmations"
3. This ensures `signUp()` creates an immediate session

**Migration**: [`20241217000001_disable_email_confirmation.sql`](migrations/20241217000001_disable_email_confirmation.sql)

### Solution 2: Handle Email Confirmation State

**Updated**: [`payment-auth-screen.tsx`](../components/payment-auth-screen.tsx:93-99)

Added check for missing session:
```typescript
// Check if session was created (email confirmation may be required)
if (!result.session) {
  console.warn('⚠️ No session created - email confirmation required')
  setError('Account created but email confirmation is required. Please check your email and then login.')
  setIsLoading(false)
  return
}
```

This prevents the confusing state by:
- Detecting when no session is created
- Showing clear error message to user
- Preventing modal from closing
- Requiring user to confirm email first

## Verification Steps

### Check Supabase Configuration

1. **Via Dashboard**:
   - Go to Authentication → Settings → Email Auth
   - Verify "Enable email confirmations" is **OFF**

2. **Via SQL**:
   ```sql
   SELECT setting_name, value
   FROM auth.config
   WHERE setting_name = 'email_confirm';
   ```
   Expected: `email_confirm` should be false or not present

### Test the Fix

1. **Create Test Account**:
   - Clear app data
   - Make a payment
   - Create account in payment auth screen
   - Should close immediately with success message

2. **Check Profile**:
   - Navigate to profile screen
   - Should show authenticated profile with email
   - NOT show login screen

3. **Verify Session**:
   - Check console logs for:
     ```
     ✅ User signed up successfully:
       hasSession: true
       sessionAccessToken: has token
     ```

4. **Verify Access**:
   - Should have access to insights
   - Profile should show logged in state
   - Both should be consistent ✅

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Approach 1: Make Profile Work Without Session
**Rejected**: Profile screen needs actual authentication, not just device-based entitlements

### Approach 2: Use Device-Based "Profile"
**Rejected**: Defeats the purpose of account creation and cross-device sync

### Approach 3: Email Confirmation with Better UX
**Possible but Complex**: Would require:
- Separate "pending confirmation" state
- Email resend functionality
- Deep linking for email confirmation
- More complex state management

**Decision**: For a mobile app with payments, immediate access (no email confirmation) is the better UX.

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users in Bad State

If users are already in the inconsistent state:

1. **Option A: Login** (If they remember password):
   - Go to profile → Login with email/password
   - Will create proper session
   - State becomes consistent

2. **Option B: Password Reset**:
   - Not implemented yet
   - Would need password reset flow

3. **Option C: Account Deletion + Recreate**:
   - Delete account in profile
   - Make payment again
   - Create account again (with fix)

### Preventing Future Issues

With email confirmation disabled:
- `signUp()` creates immediate session
- User has access via entitlements
- User has active session for profile
- State is always consistent ✅

## Support

If users still experience this issue after the fix:

1. Check Supabase logs for session creation errors
2. Verify email confirmation setting
3. Check user's auth.users record for email_confirmed_at
4. Check device_id matches in user_entitlements
5. Try login with existing credentials
